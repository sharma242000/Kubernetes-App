# Kubernetes-App

Containerizing your app involves encapsulating or packaging up the code and all its dependencies so that it can run uniformly and 
consistently on any infrastructure. It allows developers to create and deploy applications faster and more securely. 
With traditional methods, code is developed in a specific computing environment which, when transferred to a new location, often results in bugs and errors.

Containerized applications are “isolated”; in the sense that they do not bundle in a copy of the operating system. 
Instead, an open source runtime engine (such as the Docker runtime engine) is installed on the host’s operating system and 
becomes the conduit for containers to share an operating system with other containers on the same computing system.
